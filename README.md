# Data Pipeline Visualization

This Java program visualizes a simple data pipeline using JavaFX. It represents stages in the pipeline as nodes (labels) and connects them with lines.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- JavaFX library (included in JDK 8 and earlier, or separately download for JDK 11 and later).

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Didi779/data-pipeline-visualization-java.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

    ```bash
    cd data-pipeline-visualization-java
    ```

3. Compile the Java program.

    ```bash
    javac datavisualization/DataPipelineVisualization.java
    ```

4. Run the program.

    ```bash
    java datavisualization.DataPipelineVisualization
    ```

5. The JavaFX window will appear, visualizing the data pipeline.

## Description

The program uses JavaFX to create a simple graphical representation of a data pipeline. It includes nodes (labels) representing different stages in the pipeline (source, processing 1, processing 2, and sink) connected by lines.

## Usage

- The graphical visualization represents the flow of data from the source to processing stages and finally to the sink.
- Customize the visualization as needed for your specific data pipeline.
